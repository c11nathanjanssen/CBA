("read this file on the project's website":http://cba.iboard.cc/p/readme)

is "Rails3-Mongoid-Devise by fortuity":http://github.com/fortuity/rails3-mongoid-devise extended by Andi Altendorfer with

* Paperclip
* CanCan

h2. Installation

Quickstart with:

<code>   curl -o install_cba.rb https://github.com/iboard/CBA/raw/master/install.rb</code>
<code>   ruby install_cba.rb</code>

You'll be asked for the directory to create. No need to mkdir before.

 *The <code>install_cba.rb</code> will do:*

# Check if your environment fits the requirements
# Aks you some parameters
# Clones CBA from Github
# Setup configuration files

 *You have to do then:*
 
# Edit configurations files to fit your needs.
## Make sure your configured SMTP-Settings will work before you sign up.
# Start the engine <code>rails server</code>
# Sign up your first user (will be 'admin' automatically)

h2. Delayed Jobs

There is a rake-task to start the background jobs

<code>rake delayed_jobs:work</code>

Unfortunatley "DelayedJobs by 'tobi'":http://github.com/tobi/delayed_job doesn't work with MongoId.
So I did this my own way. To define new background-workers follow this steps:

# Define a worker in <code>app/workers</code> (See new_sign_up_notifier.rb for example)
# Enqueue new Jobs like shown in <code>app/model/user.rb</code>, method <code>async_notify_on_creation</code>

h2. Resource 'Page'

Since nearly any website needs some kind of 'semi-static pages' and we need some kind of object to test the application, there is a resource Page with the following features

# Consists of a title and a body
# The body is rendered with _RedCloth_
# The MongoId of <code>/page/MONGO_ID</code> in the browser-address will be replaced by <code>/p/title_of_the_page</code> with JS.
