	4/7/2011--Introduced.
Grassroots Rural and Small Community Water Systems Assistance Act of 2011 - Calls for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to prioritize the type of technical assistance that small communities find is the most beneficial. Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to: (1) authorize appropriations to the Administrator of EPA for FY2011-FY2016 for technical assistance to enable small public water systems to comply with national primary drinking water regulations; and (2) authorize the Administrator to provide technical assistance to organizations providing onsite technical assistance, circuit-rider technical assistance programs, onsite and regional training, assistance with implementing source water protection plans, and assistance with implementation monitoring plans, rules, regulations, and water security enhancements and to give preference to nonprofit organizations determined to be the most qualified, experienced, and effective and the most supported by small community water systems in the states.
