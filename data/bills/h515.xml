Includes among the criteria that the government of Belarus must meet in order to end U.S. sanctions the release of individuals who were jailed based on political beliefs or human rights violations in connection with the repression that attended the December 2010 presidential election. Authorizes the denial of U.S. entry to members of the security or law enforcement services who have participated in the crackdown on opposition leaders, journalists, and peaceful protestors or in the persecution of religious groups or human rights defenders.
