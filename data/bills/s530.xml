	<summary>
	3/9/2011--Introduced.
Amends the Internal Revenue Code to limit, after June 30, 2011, the eligibility for the income and excise tax credits for alcohol used as fuel to ethanol that qualifies as an advanced biofuel under the Clean Air Act. Requires the President to: (1) reduce semiannually the temporary duty imposed on ethanol by an amount equal to the reduction in any federal income or excise tax credit for alcohol and ethanol blends used as fuel; and (2) take other actions necessary to ensure that the combined temporary duty and any other duty imposed on ethanol is equal to, or lower than, any federal income or excise tax credit applicable to ethanol.
