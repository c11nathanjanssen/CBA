Constitutional Amendment - Grants all U.S. citizens who are 18 years of age or older the right to vote in any public election held in the jurisdiction in which the citizen resides. Prohibits the United States, any state, or any other public or private person or entity from denying or abridging the right to vote, but allows regulations narrowly tailored to produce efficient and honest elections. Requires each state to: (1) administer public elections in the state in accordance with election performance standards established by Congress, and (2) provide any eligible voter the opportunity to register and vote on the day of any public election.
