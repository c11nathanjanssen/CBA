Military and Overseas Voters' Relief Act - Amends the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (the Act) to allow any person aggrieved by a violation of voting rights under the Act to bring a civil action for necessary declaratory or injunctive relief. (Under current law, only the Attorney General may bring such an action.) Allows for the award of reasonable attorney's fees for the prevailing party. Requires a report from the Attorney General in each year in which a general election for federal office is scheduled on the number of attorneys and other staff within the Department of Justice (DOJ) assigned to enforce the Act, as well as a plan to detect noncompliance by state and local election officials with requirements of the law.
