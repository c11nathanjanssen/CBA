Domestic Energy Independence and Maritime Jobs Creation Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating to issue a certificate of documentation with a coastwise endorsement for the vessels LNG GEMINI, LNG LEO, and LNG VIRGO. Limits authorized coastwise trade for each vessel to the carriage of natural gas, as defined in the Deepwater Port Act of 1974. Prohibits a vessel transported in Dry Dock #2 (if, during such transportation, such dock remains connected by a utility or other connecting line to pierside moorage in Ketchikan, Alaska) from being considered merchandise for the purposes of certain coastwise trade requirements a vessel must otherwise meet before engaging in merchandise transportation.
