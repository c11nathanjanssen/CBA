	3/29/2011--Introduced.
Promotion and Expansion of Private Employee Ownership Act of 2011 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) extend to all domestic corporations, including S corporations, provisions allowing deferral of tax on gain from the sale of employer securities to an S corporation-sponsored employer stock ownership plan (ESOP); and (2) allow a tax deduction for 50% of the interest incurred on loans to S corporation-sponsored ESOPs for the purchase of employer securities. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish the S Corporation Employee Ownership Assistance Office to foster increased employee ownership of S corporations. Amends the Small Business Act to define &quot;ESOP business concern&quot; and allow such a concern to continue to qualify for loans, preferences, and other programs under such Act.
