	<summary>
	4/8/2011--Introduced.
Outdoor Sports Protection Act - Prohibits the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from prohibiting or otherwise restricting, the manufacture, importation, sale, or use of any traditional hunting and fishing implement based on material content. Defines &quot;traditional hunting and fishing implement&quot; as any firearm, ammunition, ammunition component, fishing lure, fishing sinker or weight, and fishing line that contains lead, zinc, copper, or brass. Requires the Administrator to report any determination that the best scientific evidence available demonstrates that the use of any such implement has a substantially detrimental effect on the environment. Prohibits the Departments of the Interior and of Agriculture (USDA) from newly prohibiting or limiting the use of any such implement on federal public lands based on material content. Directs the Secretary of either department to report any determination that the best scientific evidence available demonstrates that such use has a substantially detrimental effect on the sustainability of a local fish or wildlife population. Prohibits a state or U.S. territory from being eligible for any funding or apportionment under the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act or the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act if the state or territory newly prohibits or otherwise restricts the sale or use of any such implement based on material content.
