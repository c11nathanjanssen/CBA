	3/1/2011--Introduced.
Supreme Court Transparency and Disclosure Act of 2011 - Applies to Supreme Court justices the same code of conduct that applies to U.S. circuit and district judges. Directs the U.S. Judicial Conference to establish procedures under which complaints alleging that a justice violated such code of conduct may be filed with and investigated by the Conference. Requires a justice to publicly disclose the reasons for: (1) disqualifying himself or herself, under specified provisions of the federal judicial code, from any case in which his or her impartiality might reasonably be questioned; or (2) denying a party's motion for such disqualification. Directs the Conference to establish a process in which other justices or federal judges decide whether a justice should be disqualified when a party who is denied such a motion seeks further review.
