	<summary>
	2/18/2011--Introduced.
Small-Scale Hydropower Enhancement Act of 2011 - Exempts from certain Federal Power Act licensing requirements a hydroelectric project that uses only a non-federally owned conduit to generate electric power under 1.5 megawatts. Directs the Secretary of the Interior to revise and update the study and report on the potential for increasing electric power production capability at federally owned or operated water regulation, storage, and conveyance facilities required by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Requires: (1) the study to include facilities that would result in less than 1 megawatt of capacity; and (2) the Secretary to consult with nonfederal and noncontracting interests in carrying out this study requirement, and carry it out on a nonreimbursable basis.
