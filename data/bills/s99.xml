	<summary>
	1/25/2011--Introduced.
American Medical Isotopes Production Act of 2011 - Directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a technology-neutral program to evaluate and support projects for the production in the United States (domestic production), without the use of highly enriched uranium, of significant quantities of molybdenum-99 for medical uses, implemented in cooperation with non-federal entities, the costs of which shall be shared in accordance with certain cost sharing requirements of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Requires the Secretary to establish a program to make low enriched uranium available, through lease contracts, for irradiation for molybdenum-99 production for medical uses. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to: (1) prohibit the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) from issuing a license for the export of highly enriched uranium from the United States, beginning seven years after enactment of this Act; and (2) authorize an extension of the seven-year period for up to another three years if the Secretary makes specified certifications to appropriate congressional committees. Permits suspension of the export license restriction for a 12-month period if: (1) there is a critical shortage of molybdenum-99 to satisfy domestic medical isotope needs; (2) the Secretary certifies to Congress that the export of domestic-origin highly enriched uranium for medical isotope production is the only effective temporary means to increase the supply of molybdenum-99 necessary to meet domestic medical isotope needs during that period; and (3) Congress enacts a joint resolution approving the temporary suspension of such export license restriction. Requires the NRC Chairman to report to Congress on the current disposition of previous U.S. exports of highly enriched uranium. Amends the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to authorize the NRC to issue a license, or grant an amendment to an existing license, for the use in the United States of highly enriched uranium as a target for medical isotope production in a nuclear reactor, only if specified conditions are met, including certification by the Secretary that the federal government is actively supporting development of an alternative medical isotope production target that can be used in that reactor. Directs the Secretary to report to Congress annually for five years on Department of Energy (DOE) actions to support domestic production of molybdenum-99 for medical uses without the use of highly enriched uranium. Directs the Secretary to arrange with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to study the state of molybdenum-99 production and utilization.
