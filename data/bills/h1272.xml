Minnesota Chippewa Tribe Judgment Fund Distribution Act of 2011 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to reimburse to the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe the amount of funds plus interest earned to the date of reimbursement that the Tribe contributed for payment of attorneys' fees and litigation expenses associated with the litigation of Docket No. 19 and Docket No. 188 before the U.S. Court of Federal Claims and the distribution of judgment funds. Requires that the Tribe's claim for reimbursement of expended funds be certified by the Tribe as being unreimbursed to it from other funding sources. Requires the Tribe to provide the Secretary with updated membership rolls for the Boise Forte Band, Fond du Lac Band, Grand Portage Band, Leech Lake Band, Mille Lacs Band, and White Earth Band of the Tribe. Directs the Secretary to set aside a specified amount of the judgment funds for distribution to each member enrolled with each Band and then divide the remaining funds into equal shares for each Band.
