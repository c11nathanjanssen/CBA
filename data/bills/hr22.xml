Prohibits the aggregate amount authorized for expenses of House committees for 2011 and 2012, under primary expense resolutions adopted by the House, from exceeding 95% of the aggregated amount provided under such resolutions for 2009 and 2010. Entitles such committees, pending adoption of such primary expense resolutions, to 95% of the current amount otherwise determined.
