Expresses support for efforts that raise awareness about all childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers.
Encourages: (1) the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Institute of Mental Health, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to take steps to address the psychosocial needs of the children, adolescents, young adults, and their families living with childhood cancer; and (2) the federal government and the private sector to devote resources to find better treatments for, and build awareness of, childhood cancer and to emphasize the importance of such needs.
Urges: (1) public and private sector health organizations to take steps to increase physician, nursing, and other health care providers' awareness of those needs, as well as increase access to readily available mental health services in support of these efforts; and (2) the federal government and the private sector to invest in the development of new and improved psychosocial and medical treatments and therapies for children, adolescents, and young adults diagnosed with and surviving cancer.
