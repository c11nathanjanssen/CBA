Small Company Capital Formation Act of 2011 - Amends the Securities Act of 1933 to direct the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to exempt from its regulation a class of securities for which the aggregate offering amount is between $5 million and $50 million, subject to specified terms and conditions. Authorizes the SEC to: (1) require an issuer of such exempted class of securities to make periodic disclosures available to investors regarding the issuer, its business operations, its financial condition, and its use of investor funds; and (2) provide for the suspension and termination of such a requirement with respect to that issuer. Requires the SEC to: (1) review and increase biennially such offering amount limitation, as appropriate; and (2) report to certain congressional committees on its reasons for not increasing the amount if it determines not to do so.
