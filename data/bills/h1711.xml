Child Care Criminal Background Check Act of 2011 - Amends the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 to require child care providers that are licensed by a state or receive funds under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Program to: (1) obtain a comprehensive criminal background check of each employee who provides child care services, each applicant for employment, and each family child care provider who provides or applies to provide such services; and (2) refuse to employ individuals convicted of crimes of violence or crimes against children. Requires the state to certify that: (1) each eligible child care provider (with an exception related to child care provided by a relative) that is licensed by the state will be inspected at least at 3-month intervals; and (2) each such provider that receives funds under the Program will receive not less than 40 hours of initial training and 24 hours of training annually that includes CPR, first aid, recognizing child abuse, basic safety and health, and child behavior and development. Reduces by 10% allotments to states that fail to comply with the requirements of this Act.
