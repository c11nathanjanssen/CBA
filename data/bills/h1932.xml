	5/23/2011--Introduced.
Keep Our Communities Safe Act of 2011 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to detain indefinitely, subject to six-month review, an alien under orders of removal who cannot be removed if: (1) the alien will be removed in the reasonably foreseeable future; (2) the alien would have been removed but for the alien's refusal to cooperate with the Secretary's identification and removal efforts; (3) the alien has a highly contagious disease that poses a public safety threat; (4) release would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences; (5) release would threaten national security; (6) release would threaten the safety of any person and the alien has been convicted of either one or more aggravated felonies or crimes of violence and, because of a mental or personality condition, is likely to engage in future acts of violence; or (7) release would threaten the safety of any person and the alien has been convicted of one or more aggravated felonies. States that habeas corpus review of such detention and related actions or decisions shall be available only in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia after exhaustion of administrative remedies.
