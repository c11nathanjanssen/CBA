	5/24/2011--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that Jack Johnson (the first African-American professional boxer to hold the title of Heavyweight Champion of the World) should receive a posthumous pardon to expunge from the annals of American criminal justice a racially motivated abuse of the federal government's prosecutorial authority and to recognize his athletic and cultural contributions to society.
