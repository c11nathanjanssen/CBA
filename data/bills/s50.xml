	1/25/2011--Introduced.
Commercial Seafood Consumer Protection Act - Directs the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to strengthen federal activities for ensuring that commercially distributed seafood meets federal food quality and safety requirements. Directs the Secretary and other appropriate federal agencies to enter into agreements to strengthen interagency cooperation on seafood safety, labeling, and fraud, including regarding examining and testing seafood imports, inspections of foreign facilities, establishing a distribution chain tracking system, data sharing, and public outreach.
Requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to report deceptive seafood marketing and fraud to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Directs the Secretary to increase the number of laboratories certified to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards in the United States and in countries that export seafood to the United States to analyze food and ensure that the laboratories comply with applicable federal laws. Authorizes the Secretary to increase the number and capacity of laboratories operated by NOAA involved in testing and other activities under this Act as necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act and as provided for in appropriations Acts. Sets forth provision authorizing: (1) the refusal of admission of imported seafood or seafood products originating from a country or exporter if such seafood does not meet federal requirements, and (2) increased inspection of shipments of seafood from countries that do not meet federal requirements and that lack adequate certified laboratories. Authorizes the Secretary to send inspectors to an originating country or exporter to assess seafood practices and processes and to provide technical assistance related to U.S. requirements. Requires the development and publication of an annual list of standardized names to identify seafood at the distribution, marketing, and consumer retail stages.
