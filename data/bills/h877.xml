Expresses the sense of Congress that the Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP), and any other federal program that provides job training and placement services for older adults, should: (1) work with nonprofit organizations that have a record of success in developing and implementing research-based technology curriculum designed specifically for older adults; and (2) partner with such organizations to provide training, student materials, and support for a broad range of workforce technology skills, including basic and intermediate computer skills, Internet, email, word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, and other appropriate key skills for assisting older workers to enter or reenter the workforce.
